                    # user is logged in - redirect or do something
            }
            else {
                    # user has no account in your system
                    # detect Facebook credentials and create an account
                    # or do comething else
            } 
     }

DESCRIPTION
    This module handles Facebook Platform authentication in a Catalyst
    application.

METHODS
    As per guidelines of Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication, there are two
    mandatory methods, "new" and "authenticate".

  new()
    Will not be called by you directly, but will use the configuration you
    provide (see above). WWW::Facebook::API is required, but we also suggest
    you install Catalyst::Plugin::Facebook for ultimate Facebook integration
    after the user is authenticated.

  authenticate( )
    Handles the authentication. Nothing more, nothing less. It returns a
    Catalyst::Authentication::User::Hash (this is a user object from your
    database - the user table should have a column called "facebook_id",
    which the authenticated Facebook user is checked against)
